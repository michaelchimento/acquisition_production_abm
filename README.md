> Social learning necessarily involves both the production and transmission of behaviors across networks of individuals. To address questions of cultural evolution, both components have been modeled using two popular frameworks. The experience weighted attraction framework provides a useful model for decision-making amongst a set of behavioral choices. Network-based diffusion analysis framework is a useful model for social transmission. However, neither model alone fully accounts for both processes. We present a generative model that integrates the two frameworks by implementing a bidirectional flow of information. Networks of agents make choices that change over time as they learn from their behavioural productions. Agents have heterogeneous knowledge states that can change over time as well, and the social transmission of novel behaviours depends on their unique production distributions. We let a novel behavior diffuse through populations across a large parameter space to show how information flow between the two models reveals dependencies between behavioral production rules and diffusion dynamics of behaviors. Across network architectures, we find that sensitivity to social information can slow diffusion of a novel behavior and sensitivity to recent payoffs can hasten the diffusion of a novel behavior. Conformity of either social influence, or social learning can also slow diffusion. These effects persist in the presence of asocial learning, and depend on memory and the relative strength of social learning. Finally, we find that learning parameters from the experience weighted attraction model, used often in the literature as evidence for social learning, cannot be reliably inferred when individuals have heterogeneous knowledge states. Synthesizing these two models illuminates the important distinction between production and diffusion processes in cultural evolution, and provides new theoretical insights that can guide future hypotheses and analyses.
