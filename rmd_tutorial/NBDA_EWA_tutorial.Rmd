## Introduction

This companion document is mean to directly show how the agent based model is implemented and operates under the hood.

Let's load the required libraries. The networks of agents are handled by [networkx](https://networkx.org/), a very powerful library that has many options for graph creation.

```{python}
from collections import Counter
import math
import sys
import networkx as nx
import random
import numpy as np
from os.path import isfile,join
from multiprocessing import Pool,Lock,Value,Manager
import pandas as pd
from os import listdir,cpu_count
```
