    "We can take advantage of Python's classes and object oriented programming to increase the flexibility of the model, and make life easier when the model becomes complicated. Let's define a class called ```behavior```. Each instance of ```behavior``` will represent a possible behavior that agents will be able to learn during the simulation. Any python class can be given its own variables and methods using ```self.var_name``` convention. Here, we define a initialization method that assigns each instance of a behavior with a name, an associated payoff, and a base hazard rate. The payoff will be used later during the EWA portion of the model, and the base hazard is used in the NBDA portion of the model. The base hazard represents the likelihood of acquiring the behavior at each timestep which is independent of any social or asocial influence. A higher base hazard value essentially means the behavior will be easier to acquire."
